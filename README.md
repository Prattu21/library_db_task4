### Using Aggregate Functions
Aggregate functions like SUM(), AVG(), COUNT() are used to perform calculations on numeric data — for example, finding the total, average, or highest value in a column.

### Using having clause
The HAVING clause filters the results of grouped data created by GROUP BY. It is similar to WHERE, but used for groups — for example, showing only categories where total sales are greater than 1000.

### Using Group by clause
The GROUP BY clause groups rows that have the same values in specified columns. It helps to summarize data — for instance, calculating total sales per product or average marks per student.
